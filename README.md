1.2 - File Overview
This file, sprint_114, is the official Sprint 2 submission for Project Cypress. Itâ€™s organized following the course requirements for Sprints 2 and 3, and it outlines the current status of our software engineering project. Cypress is a community-focused web platform that enables citizens to report local issues directly to city authorities using an interactive map interface. Our Sprint 2 goal was to establish a foundational product backlog, implement high-priority features, and prepare for thorough testing in Sprint 3.

1.3 - Contents of this File
Product Backlog - Complete list of user stories and tasks with assigned priorities, estimated time to completion, actual effort (where applicable), and implementation status.
Team Velocity Diagram - Visual representation of team performance measured in story points throughout the sprint.
Sprint 3 Test Plan - Well-documented testing framework for general, user, admin, security, and performance functionality. Includes inputs, expected outputs, and criteria for success.

1.4 - Project Description
Cypress is designed to empower citizens by making it easier to report and handle local issues. Citizens can quickly report issues (potholes, streetlight outages, or graffiti) using its user-friendly map-based reporting interface and secure login system. They can also receive updates as city authorities handle and address their complaints. In turn, the dashboard allows city authorities to examine, assign, filter, and evaluate concerns that have been reported. The system includes features to prevent spam, enhance user experience, and ensure data integrity.
